Yet, the ability to accomplish objectives without supervision is the critical north star for agent progress, especially in software creation. For non-technical users who cannot supervise software creation, full autonomy is essential, not optional.\\n\\nFirst of all, I will discuss two foundational capabilities to achieve true autonomy: automatic testing to verify correctness without human validation, and advanced context management to maintain coherence across complex, long-horizon tasks.\\n\\nWith autonomy established, parallelization becomes the key to delivering a compelling user experience. Sequential execution forces users to wait extensively before seeing progress, breaking the development flow. This talk explores parallelization models (task-level parallelism, out-of-order execution, plan decomposition, etc.) and their tradeoffs in latency, resource consumption, and correctness guarantees.","since":"2025-11-20T09:25:00","endsAt":"2025-11-20T09:44:00","trackName":"AI Leadership","room":"Times Center","roomOther":"Times Center","presenters":[{"attributes":{"name":"Michele Catasta","tagline":"VP of AI","company":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"Replit"}}},"profilePhoto":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/speakers/michele-catasta.jpg"}}},"socialLinks":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/pirroh","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pirroh","github":"https://github.com/pirroh"}}}],"slug":"building-the-future-of-coding-replit","displayOrder":3,"recordingLink":null,"type":"SESSION","isPlenumSession":false},{"id":"session-4","title":"Your Support Team Should Ship Code","about":"Zapier maintains 8000+ integrations that break as APIs change. We had thousands of backlog support tickets with dozens more arriving weekly. To keep up with the traffic, we started building AI tools to help ship integration fixes faster.\\nWe began by shadowing engineers fixing tickets and building tools we believed would expedite the fix process. Our first effort, an API playground hosting AI tools like diagnosis and test generation, failed to get engineering traffic because it pulled builders out of their workflows. We pivoted to MCP tools that engineers could use directly in their IDEs. MCP tools gained traction, but our most valuable tool, Diagnosis, took too long to run. Engineers wouldn\'t wait for it, revealing we needed an asynchronous approach. We built Scout Agent to string our tools together, autonomously reading support tickets, gathering context, generating fixes with tests, and submitting merge requests ready for review. This agent approach has gained traction with our support team handling high ticket volumes. An MR ready for review means they can validate and ship a fix quickly before needing to jump on the next incoming ticket.\\nThroughout this process we\'ve learned that the real challenge is everything surrounding code generation. Before writing code, Scout Agent needs both the right context and to show its work so engineers trust its recommendations. After generation, engineers need to quickly validate and correct the proposed fix, otherwise MRs sit unreviewed and abandoned. Embedding Scout Agent directly in GitLab solved this. Teams can iterate on proposed solutions without context switching.\\nTo track improvement, we measure three distinct failure modes: categorization accuracy (should Scout attempt this ticket?), fixability assessment (does this need a code fix?), and solution quality (does the generated code actually work?). Each reveals different improvement opportunities. Today, Scout drives 40% of support\'s integration fixes, with expansion to engineering teams and downstream automation (testing, shipping, migration) as our next frontiers.","since":"2025-11-20T09:45:00","endsAt":"2025-11-20T10:04:00","trackName":"AI Leadership","room":"Times Center","roomOther":"Times Center","presenters":[{"attributes":{"name":"Lisa Orr","tagline":"Product Leader","company":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"Zapier"}}},"profilePhoto":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"/speakers/lisa-orr.jpg"}}},"socialLinks":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/orreither","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisaorr"}}}],"slug":"your-support-team-should-ship-code","displayOrder":4,"recordingLink":null,"type":"SESSION","isPlenumSession":false},{"id":"session-5","title":"2026: The Year the IDE Died","about":"As AI has grown more capable, software developers around the world have lagged behind the technology advances, and have consistently eschewed the most powerful tools.

It\'s a portable, composable approach to giving one agent capabilities across domains.

Earlier this year, OpenAI released the OpenAI Agents SDK to bring the patterns they have found to work for building agents to the developer community. With the SDK you can define AI agents by supplying them instructions (prompts), specifying which model to use (OpenAI or not), listing tools it uses (including MCP), and much more. The OpenAI Agents SDK encourages a paradigm of orchestrated micro-agents, which themselves may have micro-orchestrations within them with the use of handoffs. It’s an elegant and powerful model.\\n\\nBut a good AI Agents programming model is not enough. These agents are ultimately wildly distributed systems and are plagued with all of the problems such systems bring. \\n- How can they persevere through flakey networks?\\n- How can they function when LLMs are rate limited?\\n- How can they run for long periods of time (hours, days, weeks, months) when infrastructure is rarely stable that long?\\n\\nIn this workshop, we’ll show you how. Temporal is an open source (MIT license) durable execution framework that brings resilience to AI agents, and in this workshop we’ll show you how it’s done with the OpenAI Agents SDK. Spoiler: OpenAI and Temporal have done all of the heaving lifting for you with an [integration announced earlier this year](https://temporal.io/blog/announcing-openai-agents-sdk-integration). \\n\\nOh, and OpenAI themselves use Temporal to help make several of their products production ready ([image gen](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images) and [Codex](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/embirico_hello-openais-new-codex-agent-they-activity-7330357161992011776-YVUl/), for example).\\n\\nNot using the OpenAI Agents SDK?
